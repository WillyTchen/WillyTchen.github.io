		 <h1>Usability Study</h1>
			 <h2>Method</h2>
		 			<p>We studied my website portfolio. The target audience is peers in my grade level. The three tasks I assigned to my subjects were to look for an image of my student ID, look a radio button form that says "payment methods", and look for a video of code.org.</p>
		 	 <h2>Results</h2>
		 			<p>Yes, most of my subjects were able to complete the tasks you assigned them. It was easy for them. In general, it took them 2-3 minutes to do each task.</p>
			 <h2>Discussion</h2>
		 			<p>I learned that the best way to look for flaws in your website is to get additional pairs of eyes. Yes, the current design is effective because the results indicate that the students could complete my tasks without much effort. I could make the navigation bar more distinct, so that students could more easily notice it rather than ignore it.</p>
